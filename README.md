- 👋 Hi, I’m @CZCollins
- 👀 I'm interested in finding the best ways to advance my coding skills. Ive been making games, solving beginner problems etc.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I have only been coding python for about 2 months. My best project so far is a text-based adventure game where you can move throughout rooms, collect items and place them into your inventory, etc. The typical beginner project. For now I want to stick with python until I am more advanced. Im hoping this will help me wrap my head around the foundational concepts of coding as best I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. At this point in my journey, it doesnt matter what im coding, if im coding at all, im learning. 
- 📫 If your nice enough to want to spread some knowledge my way, or want to work on some sort of beginner project, feel free to send me a dm.
